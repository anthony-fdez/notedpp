# Noted++
This is yet another note taking website. Built with Next.js. I built this project just for fun to freshen up my typescript skills but mainly to learn to work on the backend side of the app. 

Fun fact, I ended up using this app as my main note taking app, and I'm the only one using it. The cost to host the server and database is about $25 a month, so I'm basicaly paying for the most expensive note taking app ever lol
